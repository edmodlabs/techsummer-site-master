TechStart is shipping VR Kits to participating classrooms that will inspire participation in computer science through the cutting edge medium of virtual reality. We provide the hardware and basic educational materials so that classrooms can integrate virtual reality as they see fit into their classrooms.

* One Starter Kit documenting how to use TechStart equipment in a school.
* One Oculus-Ready computer that meets the Oculus minimum specs and is approved by Oculus IT.
* Mouse and Keyboard
* One Oculus Rift
* One 24‚Äù Monitor

No further equipment is needed to complete the TechStart projects.

## How will the equipment be used? 
We provide instructions to get started. It is up to the teachers themselves to decide and innovate on how they would like to integrate the VR kit into their classrooms.
