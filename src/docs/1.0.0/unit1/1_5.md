Now you’re going to get started with Vizor, a platform for building VR experiences. 

## Using Vizor

  </div> 
  You’ll use your computer to create and publish Vizor experiences. After you publish, you will visit your experience on your phone's broswer to try what you built in VR.

Before you continue, make sure you remember the Vizor account information that you used in the Storycast application and login here: https://patches.vizor.io.  If you didn’t have an account or don’t remember your account, you can create a new one but make sure to inform the program team so you can stay in the loop.
