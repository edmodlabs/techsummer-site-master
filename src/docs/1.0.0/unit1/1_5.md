## Overview
Now you’re going to get started with Vizor, a platform for building VR experiences. 

## Using Vizor
<div class="alert_red">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Computer or Phone?</strong>
  </div> 
  You’ll use your computer to build and publish Vizor experiences. After you publish, you will visit your experience on your phone's broswer to try what you built in VR.
</div>

Before you continue, make sure you remember the Vizor account information that you used in the Storycast application and login here: https://patches.vizor.io.  If you didn’t have an account or don’t remember your account, you can create a new one but make sure to inform the program team so you can stay in the loop.  

Most of Vizor building is done through the <strong>Edit Mode</strong>, which can be accessed only while on a computer browser (not your phone) by clicking on the screen then pressing the <strong>pencil icon</strong>.  We recommend either the Chrome or Safari browsers for Vizor editing.

	Edit Mode
</div>

Any Vizor project can be copied through <strong>Duplication</strong>.  That means all Vizor projects you encounter throughout the program or elsewhere on the Vizor platform are open for your own tinkering!  Duplicate a project now!

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Duplicate Your Project Template</strong>
  </div> 
  <ul>
  	<li> Visit the following blank template project: https://patches.vizor.io/techsummer/grid. </li>
    <li> Select the **Edit** button. </li>
  	<li> Select the **Duplicate** button.</li>
  </ul> 
  <div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="/images/techsummer/Unit1/VizorMatrix/Duplicate.gif">
	<br>
	Edit any Vizor project you see using Duplication
  </div>
</div>

Navigating around the editor window is done with your mouse.  Use the left mouse button to click and drag to rotate the scene.  Use the right mouse button and click and drag to pan the scene up, down, left or right.  Use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out.  If you’re not currently using a mouse, we highly recommend using one for working within Vizor!

Vizor is all about adding and building CG worlds using 3D objects.  To add a 3D object to your world, navigate to the **Menu** and select the **Object** you’d like to add to your world. To delete an **Object**, select the **Object** and hit <i>Delete</i> on your keyboard.

<div style="text-align:center">

	<br>
	Use the Menu to browse and add objects.
</div>

Our **Lab Object** looks a little strange because it’s not correctly placed in the grid room.  Luckily, we have the power to **move**, **scale**, and **rotate** in the Vizor editor!  When an **Object** is selected, there are three directions of different colors (blue, red, and green) that appear, like with our **Lab Object**.  Select, click, and drag each arrow with the mouse to move the object in different directions.  This works the same way with the **rotate** and **scale** tools, too.  There are hotkeys for these tools on the keyboard.  Use **M**, **S** and **R** (for **Move**, **Scale** and **Rotate**) as shortcuts.  Do you feel like a CG superhero yet!?

Have you noticed the weird little object of a head wearing goggles?  Many CG applications use multiple cameras angles to view a project.  In Vizor, there are two cameras: the **Editor Camera** and the **VR Camera**. You can toggle between them by selecting their buttons in the bottom right of the editor or pressing **V** on the keyboard.  In our example, when we switch to the **VR Camera** we get teleported inside the table, ouch!  We have to adjust the **VR Camera** by selecting the goggles object and moving with the move tool.  Much better!

	Switch the camera mode and adjust the VR Camera to a place of your choosing

## Testing
Now it’s time to test your Vizor creation in your DIY VR Viewer!

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Make Changes</strong>
  </div> 
  Before you continue, make sure you have completed the following.
  <ul>
  	<li> Add and move at least one **Object** from the **Menu** in your scene. </li>
    <li> Move the **VR Camera** to a position of your choice. </li>
  </ul> 
</div>

To test your experience, we need to save the experience to the internet. Saving in Vizor works by **publishing** your project.  There are two **publish modes**: **public** and **private**.  **Private** means only you can see the project in your dashboard, **public** means anybody with the link can view your project.  You’ll mostly want to **publish** to **public** since you need to access the project on your phone.  

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Publish</strong>
  </div> 
  Use the following steps to publish and test your project.
  <ul>
  	<li> Publish your project now by pressing the **Publish** button, giving your project a name, and **publishing** as **public**. </li>
    <li> Move the **VR Camera** to a position of your choice. </li>
    <li> Select the **Share** button (an **arrow icon**) to get the link to your project. </li>
    <li> Visit the link on your smartphone and select **VR mode** to experience your project in your VR viewer!</li>
    <div style="text-align:center">
		<img src="/images/techsummer/Unit1/VizorMatrix/Publish.gif">
		<br>
		Use the publish tool to save, share, and then test projects
	</div>
  </ul> 
</div>

<div class="alert_yellow">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Versioning</strong>
  </div> 
  If you are publishing versions of the same project, add a number to the end of the name.  Every time you publish a new version, use an increasing number so you can always go back to your older projects in case you make a mistake.  In engineering, we call that naming style <i>versioning.</i>
