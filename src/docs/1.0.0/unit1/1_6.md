## Overview
We are going to put **Character Objects** into our **Scene** and play around with their sizes.

## Scale
Take note of how different your project looks when you experience it in your viewer.  The first storytelling tool of virtual reality that you will use in your Storycast is <i>scale</i>.  By making objects bigger or smaller, you are changing the perspective of how the world looks to the user.  This can be a crucial part of your story.  For example, if your Storycast is about a penguin that gets zapped with an Expander Ray Gun 3000, you can scale 3D objects to make it look like the penguin is growing larger!

  <ul>
  	<li> Go to the **Objects: Character** option in the **Menu** and add two different **Character Objects** to your current project. </li>
    <li> **Move** and **scale** the objects so they are of two entirely different sizes. </li>
  	<li> **Publish** the project and use the hyperlink to test.  Remember you can use the **move** tool to change the **VR Camera** position if the camera starts somewhere strange.  </li>
  </ul>

  Take a phone screenshot of your current Vizor world while in **VR Camera** mode.  Make sure we can see the two different characters in the scene.  Post the picture to the [Facebook group](https://fb.com/groups/techsummer) to share your current story of scale!
