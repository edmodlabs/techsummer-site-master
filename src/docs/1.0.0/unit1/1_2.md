## Overview
In this section you will be using your VR Viewer to try virtual reality!

## Using Your Viewer

  	<strong>Try VR</strong>
  </div> 
  Follow the steps below to try a virtual reality experience with your viewer.
</div>

1. Open the default mobile web browser for your phone.  Open <i>Google Chrome</i> if you have an <i>Android</i> phone or <i>Safari</i> if you have an <i>Apple</i> phone.  Make sure your phone is updated, Safari is known to not work with WebVR on older iOS versions.

	Use Google Chrome on Android

  	<strong>What's the Difference?</strong>
  </div> 
  Every phone has an <i>OS</i>, or operating system. Most non-Apple phones are <i>Android</i> phones. <i>Apple</i> phones use <i>iOS</i>, or the iPhone operating system. An OS manages the hardware and software on a phone - that's why depending on your phone you need to use a different web browser.
</div>

2. There’s a great big world of WebVR experiences: games, films, multiplayer experiences, tours, and more. For your first experience, we’ll try an example Storycast! You can later try more experiences in the [Resources](https://techsummer.github.io/resources/). Enter the following hyperlink into your mobile web browser: https://vizor.io/techsummer/birds-feather.

3. Turn your phone sideways to enter <i>Landscape</i> mode.

4. Tap on the main screen area to bring up the Vizor menu and select <i>VR Mode</i> (tap on the goggles icon).
<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

5. Once in VR Mode, the image should be split into two images, one for your right eye and one for your left eye. Notice that each image is slightly different!

6. Insert your phone into your DIY VR Viewer. If you have a phone case, you probably need to remove the case phone. Be careful! The hinges on the Phone Holder pieces bend but might break if you push too hard. You can find one replacement Phone Holder in your DIY VR Viewer kit.

<div class="alert_red">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>WARNING</strong>
  </div> 
  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS hold your phone when you are using your VR viewer, instead of holding the VR viewer. If you hold the viewer and not your phone, your phone could fall out and break! Remember to make sure others trying your VR viewer also hold onto the phone!
</div>

7. Use your head! Look through the lenses to see the VR experience.  Look around to change what you see, but keep in mind that your physical position does not change. Your phone can keep track of where you are looking but not your motion.

8. The VR experience will not appear clearly if the Lenses do not match your <i>interpupillary distance</i> (IPD), which is the distance between your eyes. Grab the Lens Holders and adjust them left and right until the experience appears clearly.

  </div> 
  The average IPD for adults is 63mm. What’s your IPD? If you line up the triangular notch on the Lens Holders with the middle triangular notch on the Base, you have set up the Lenses for an IPD of about 63mm. 
</div>

9. Tap your finger on the phone screen to interact with a VR experience.  It doesn’t matter where you tap but for some applications it does matter where you are looking when you tap.  In the experience, you can navigate around scenes by looking at the <b>Next</b> button and tapping the screen. 

## How VR Works

Multiple technologies make VR possible and many styles of VR exist, so we’ll focus on what you just tried: <i>WebVR</i>.  WebVR enables a web page to drive a VR experience and multiple technologies are involved.

Like you saw before, a flat screen such as your phone displays two slightly different images of the same experience, one for each of your eyes.  To draw those images, a technology called <i>WebGL</i> is used. WebGL enables the browser on your phone or laptop to draw high quality images.  

VR also needs to be able to track a user. Tracking a user is important for WebGL to be able to update the images according to where the user is looking. To do so, your phone uses an <i>inertial measurement unit</i> (IMU). An IMU uses multiple sensors to track a device. An accelerometer measures acceleration, a gyrometer measures rotations, and so on. The IMU in your phone combines all of the sensors to track the phone. As a result, your phone can update the image as you look around!

  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>IMU Limitations</strong>
  </div> 
  Using an IMU to track a device has imperfections. Most importantly, IMU's in phones cannot track motion. That's why the image does not change in your VR viewer if you try to walk around.
