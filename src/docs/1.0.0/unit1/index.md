## Overview

In this activity, you will assemble your very own customizable VR viewer and learn about the technology underlying VR. VR is like great food: you could talk about it for days, but you really need to try it to understand why it’s great. So, let’s jump in!

## Assembly

  Follow the steps below to assemble your VR viewer.

	Overview of Assembly Pieces
</div>

1. Grab the <i>DIY VR Kit</i> and unbox all the parts.

</div>
To assemble the viewer, make sure you have the following: <i>1 Right Lens Holder, 1 Left Lens Holder, 2 Phone Holders, 2 Lenses, 1 Base, 1 Cover, 4 Screws, 4 Nuts, 2 Pin Holders, 1 Screwdriver.</i>

2. Place each Lens in any Lens Holder.  Align the three Lens tabs with the three open tabs on the Lens Holder, push the Lens into place, and twist to secure the Lens.  The more round side of each Lens should face toward the part of the Lens Holder with the open tabs.

  	<strong>VR Lenses</strong>
  </div> 
  The lenses are <i>biconvex lenses</i> because each side is round. Biconvex lenses focus light and images.  On your VR viewer, the lenses will focus the image from your phone's screen.  Pop out your lenses later to see why that matters.
</div>

3. Place the Left Lens Holder into the Base's left side and the Right Lens Holder into the Base's right side. The more round side of each Lens must be face up.

4. Place the Cover on top of the Base with the Lens Holders sandwiched in the middle.

</div>

5. Place Phone Holders on top of the Cover. There is a hole on the Phone Holder pieces so they can slide onto protruding nubs on the Cover.

</div>

6. Place each Pin Holder on top of the Cover. Protruding nubs on the Pin Holder should slide into holes on the top of the Phone Holder. Also, protruding nubs on the Cover will help you to keep the Pin Holder in place.

</div>

7. Push Screws through the holes on the bottom corners of the Cover. The Screw should go all the way through the Cover and Base. Use the Screwdriver if necessary and fasten nuts to the other end by hand.  If you want to fasten a nut even more, hold the nut in place while screwing the Screws.

8. Repeat the instructions above for the holes at the top of the Cover. Each Screw should go through a Pin Holder, the Cover, and the Base.

9. Ensure the Phone Holders can swivel in and out and that your entire viewer is bound together.

  	<strong>Focal Distance</strong>
  </div> 
  The Lenses have a <i>focal distance</i> of approximately 40mm which means the Lenses bring an image into focus at about 40mm.  For any VR viewer, the distance from the lenses to the screen should roughly match the focal distance. 
</div>

10. Congratulations - you built your own VR Viewer!  Use the felt pouch when carrying your viewer in a backpack or your pocket to avoid scratching the lenses.
