## Overview of StoryCasts

A Storycast is about bringing virtual life to your voice by learning computer graphics and storytelling skills.  Think about a story that could be told next to a roaring fire or under a starry night sky.  It could be about a dramatic personal experience, the history of an event in your community, or a fictional hero’s adventure.  With a Storycast, you create the environment, characters, and situations to shape an immersive world using the emerging field of virtual reality storytelling! 

Techniques that you learn through a Storycast are commonly employed by animation studios such as Pixar, Dreamworks, or Lucasfilm.  You’ll borrow strategies from industry-leading organizations and learn how to combine proven storytelling skills with cutting edge virtual reality applications.

A Storycast is a virtual reality (VR) story told in three parts: a beginning, middle, and end. It contains a voice-over from the narrator (that's YOU!) and uses 3D graphics in a web platform called Vizor.  Vizor uses computer graphics (CG) and provides a visual interface to build on top of technologies such as WebGL and WebVR. CG is a field of computer science used to create art, models, animations, films, games, and more.  VR storytelling is brand new, and even companies like Facebook are still discovering how it works. As part of the Storycast program, you will be an important part of pioneering the new process of storytelling using virtual reality!
