## Installing Firefox Nightly
Virtual Reality is an extremely new, experimental, and uncharted medium and format. WebVR is even more bleeding edge and experimental. On PCs, we need a special browser that has the experimental implementation to consume virtual reality on the web. We will use FireFox Nightly, an experimental browser used for testing all the newest features that will eventually be added to Firefox.  The following instructions are adapted from [https://mozvr.com/#start].

* Download the https://nightly.mozilla.org/ (64-bit version unless you are certain you have a 32-bit machine).
* Open the Firefox Nightly browser.
* Download the following add on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozilla-webvr-enabler/
* Ensure that your Oculus settings allow for Unknown Sources.
	
## Experiencing WebVR
* Check out the following projects and confirm you can open them up in WebVR by pressing the “Enter VR” button [https://mozvr.com/#showcase].
* Check out these examples as well. They are all made using the graphics package that we will be using to create WebVR, A-Frame. [https://aframe.io/blog/]
