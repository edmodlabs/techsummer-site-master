## Overview of Storycasts

A Storycast is about bringing virtual life to your voice by learning computer graphics (CG) and storytelling skills.  You could build a story about a personal experience, an event in your community, or anything you come up with.  You create the environment, characters, and situations to shape an immersive world using the emerging field of virtual reality (VR) storytelling! 

Techniques you learn through a Storycast are commonly employed by animation studios such as Pixar, Dreamworks, and Lucasfilm.  You’ll borrow strategies from industry-leading organizations and learn how to combine proven storytelling skills with cutting edge VR applications.

A Storycast is a VR story with three parts: a beginning, middle, and end. It contains a voice-over from the narrator (that's YOU!) and uses 3D graphics on a platform called Vizor.  Vizor uses CG and provides a visual interface to build your story. CG is a field of computer science used to create art, models, animations, films, games, and more.  VR storytelling is brand new and even companies like Facebook are still exploring how it works.  As part of the program, you'll interact with a Facebook technology team and be part of pioneering the new process of storytelling using VR!

Storycasts contains 4 units.
- <strong>Unit 1: Build Your Reality</strong> - assemble your own VR viewer, experience WebVR, and be introduced to Vizor to build your own experiences.  
- <strong>Unit 2: Never Sacrifice Story</strong> - learn digital storytelling fundamentals and lock down a plan for your Storycast.  
- <strong>Unit 3: Objects Galore</strong> - expand on your Vizor skillset to juggle many 3D objects, 360 images, and sound files.
- <strong>Unit 4: Adding Agency</strong> - polish your project with advanced CG concepts such as animation, user interaction, and lighting.  

Units 3 and 4 are the most time-consuming and challenging.  Polishing and releasing a story is not easy! Plan accordingly and ask for help when necessary.  It's a great idea to join the [TechSummer Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/techsummer/) so you can get help there too.

By the end of the program, you should have a complete Storycast project you can share with anyone and a better idea of what it takes to build stories using tech.  Let’s get started!

### Text Formats and Flags

Throughout the instructions, text formats will help you understand content. <strong>Bold words</strong> indicate Vizor terms. For example, you will see <strong>Patches, Beginning Scene, Program Mode, Build Mode,</strong> and more. <i>Italic words</i> indicate important concepts and terms such as <i>virtual reality, computer graphics, visual programming,</i> and more.

The guide contains special sections called <i>flags</i> with different purposes.
