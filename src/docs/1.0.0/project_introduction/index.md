## Overview of StoryCasts

A Storycast is about bringing virtual life to your voice by learning computer graphics (CG) and storytelling skills.  You could build a story about a personal experience, an event in your community, or anything you come up with.  You create the environment, characters, and situations to shape an immersive world using the emerging field of virtual reality (VR) storytelling! 

Techniques you learn through a Storycast are commonly employed by animation studios such as Pixar, Dreamworks, and Lucasfilm.  Youâ€™ll borrow strategies from industry-leading organizations and learn how to combine proven storytelling skills with cutting edge VR applications.

A Storycast is a VR story told in three parts: a beginning, middle, and end. It contains a voice-over from the narrator (that's YOU!) and uses 3D graphics on a web platform called Vizor.  Vizor uses CG and provides a visual interface to build your story. CG is a field of computer science used to create art, models, animations, films, games, and more.  VR storytelling is brand new and even companies like Facebook are still exploring how it works. As part of the program, you'll interact with a Facebook technology team and be part of pioneering the new process of storytelling using VR!
