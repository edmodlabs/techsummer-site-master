## Vizor Project

Virtual Reality Starter Project

**Lesson Plan + Skill Mappings**

* Should we tie to ESSA, CC, or other mappings educators are comfortable with?

**Project Prompt & Goals (10 min, 1 min)**

Get ready to jump into the world of virtual reality development! By the end of the project, you will:

* Get a first taste of how computer graphics can be applied to creative projects.
* Use a creative platform named Vizor to build a virtual world you can share with anyone using a VR headset.
* Learn the basics of designing a virtual world.

**Requirements**

* The Virtual Reality Starter Project is designed to be completed by individual students, not teams.
* WebVR Set Up
* What is VR?

**Computer Graphics and VR (10 min, 2 min)**

Computer graphics, also known as CG, is an area of computer science which uses computers to create pictures, models, films, and more. Computer graphics emerged in the United States in the 1950's and since then computer graphics has been used for many applications.

With a knowledge computer graphics you can...

You can use a computer graphics program like PhotoShop to design user interfaces!

If you can to build 3-dimensional (3D) models of objects, use a program like Blender!
[gif, meme, or picture]
You can create movies, video games, and more using computer programs such as Adobe Final Cut, Unity or Unreal, and more!

Computer graphics is also the basis of building a virtual reality experience! Here are some virtual worlds built using the vizor.io platform.

**Vizor Basics (60 min, 5 min)**

Enough talk - let's jump into Vizor and get started!

*Creating a Vizor Account*
You'll first need to create a Vizor account.

* Navigate to vizor.io and click on the “Sign Up” button.
* F ill out your information on the “Sign Up” screen and click “Create an Account.” 
* You should see a new screen with links to Vizor tutorials, the Vizor Facebook, and more. Click the “X” button, wait for the scene to load, and you're now in the Vizor editor!

*Vizor Editor Guide: Navigation*
There are lots of options and buttons in the Vizor editor, but we do not need all of them. Let's start with learning how to navigate in the editor.

* You can scroll in and out using your mouse or mouse pad to zoom.

[screen capture]

* You can left click and drag to rotate. 

[screen capture]

* You can right click and drag to pan.

Play around with navigation in the Vizor editor until you feel comfortable. When you're ready to move on, navigate until you can see a model of a head wearing a VR headset.
[Image: https://fb.quip.com/-/blob/eTBAAA16Hv2/6FTJB0s-Q4R_XfZgIyocAw]*Vizor Editor Guide: Cameras*
Many computer graphics programs use multiple cameras. Most often, one “world camera” will show you a view of everything you are building. Think of the world camera as the camera you use for creating and building. You can move the camera wherever you want to make your work easier. In Vizor, the world camera is called “Editor camera” and you can select the camera in the editor. 

[screen capture: hover over the Editor camera]

When you open the Vizor editor, you should be using the Editor camera by default. When we were navigating before, we were using the world camera.

A world camera in computer graphics is great for making your work easier, but what will a user's point of view be when an application starts? Imagine that the user's point of view was the same as your world camera. You'd have to move the world camera while building your project then move the camera back to where you want your user to start before anyone could try your project. It would be much more convenient to be able to set a place where the user's view will begin. For that reason, many computer graphics programs have a second camera to represent a user's view. In Vizor, that camera is called the “VR camera” and represents where a user's view will be when they start your virtual reality experience. You can see your scene from the VR camera view by clicking the button next to the Editor camera button.

[screen capture: enter VR camera mode, click and drag to simulate head turn]

When in the VR camera mode, you can click and drag to test what it would be like for a user to look around your scene.

**Hello Virtual World! (45 min, 15 min)**

You've learned about the basics of cameras in computer graphics and now it's time to get building! 

*Fun With Objects*

In Vizor, you can add 3D objects via the “Patches Menu.” The Patches Menu contains two tabs. The “Objects” tab provides a list of objects you can add into your scene. The “Patches” tab allows you to use computer programming to make your scene dynamic and we will explore those options later. If you do not see the Patches Menus, click the “Patches” button in the “Vizor editor. You can also click and drag the menu around.

[screen capture: toggle patches menu, click and drag patches menu]

Now let's add an object!

* Select the Objects tab in the Patches Menu.
* Select the objects “Objects: Basic” option, then select the “Box.”

You should now see a 3-dimensional box in your scene. You can use the Vizor editor to change the position, size, or rotation of any object. 


* Select your object. You know you've selected an object when red, green, and blue lines appear by the object. Each line represents an “axis” you can use to adjust the object. The plural form of axis is “axes,” which is pronounced “axe-zeez”. 
* Select the “Move” button, then click and drag on any of the object axes to change the object position.

[screen capture]

* Select the “Scale” button, then click and drag on any of the object axes to make the object bigger or smaller. 

[screen capture]

* Select the “Rotate” button, then click and drag on any of the object axes to change the object rotation.

[screen capture]

Finally, you can delete an object at any time by selecting the object and pressing “Backspace” or “Delete” on your keyboard.

*Building a World*

Now that you know the basics of Vizor, you're all set to start building your first virtual world. Add objects to your scene using the “Patches Menu” and modify as much as you'd like. We recommend only using objects in the Object menu that are in the “Objects:” items.

**Share With The World (45 min, 10 min)**

One of the coolest parts about Vizor is the ability to share what you build. After you project is done, anyone with a VR headset can see what you built. 

*Publishing and Viewing*
To publish your project, click the “Publish” button in the Vizor editor. A screen should pop up. Give your project a name and hit the “Publish” button to put your project on the internet for anyone to see.

[Image: https://fb.quip.com/-/blob/eTBAAA16Hv2/Bw-lMoxTMJ98d5lHrhcTxg]Once you hit “Publish” you'll be taken to a website with the URL of vizor.io/(your username)/(your project name). So if your username is “techstart” and your project name is “my_project,” the URL for your Vizor project is vizor.io/techstart/my_project. You can view, edit and delete all of your projects at vizor.io/(your username).

To view the project in WebVR, you'll need to use the Oculus Rift headset provided by TechStart. Go to the computer with the Oculus Rift, open Firefox Nightly, and enter the URL of your published project. If you click near the bottom of the screen, you'll see an icon which looks like binoculars. On the internet, the icon is often used to start a VR experience. Click the icon and put the headset on to see what you made in virtual reality!

*Submission*
If you'd like to be eligible for TechStart awards, be sure to complete the following.

* Complete and publish a scene in Vizor. You don't need to build the best project in the world. We just want you to submit a project you spent time on and would be happy to show someone, with the exception of inappropriate content. Inappropriate content will not be eligible for awards.

[Image: https://fb.quip.com/-/blob/eTBAAA16Hv2/hAesoR6NJKjJg_62tzduFw]
* Make sure your project can be viewed at vizor.io/(your username), share your username with your teacher, and complete the following 5 minute survey: link to post survey.
* Remind your teacher to save your username and share your username with the TechStart team on the end of the year survey they will complete.
