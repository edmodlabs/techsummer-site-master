## Overview
You have a basic understanding of **patches**. For the rest of Storycasts, we will gradually introduce more **patch** concepts to spice up your story.

## Patch Editing

Let’s demonstrate your new **patch** skills by editing your story's title.  You can always change the title later! Come up with something catchy related to your “what if” question.  Enter the **Title Scene** **nested patch** to see contents of the title scene.

    <strong>Where's My Scene?</strong>
  </div> 
  Even if you enter a **patch** for a scene in **Program** mode, you may not see that scene in the editor. To do so, enter **Build** mode and use the keyboard hotkeys **J/K/L/P**.
</div>

When you **duplicated** the **Storycast template** to start **editing**, the title text may have disappeared (this is a known Vizor <i>bug</i>). You can get the text back by reconnecting the **blue text** **patches** to the corresponding **nested patches**.  Just click and drag from the **white slot** on one **patch** to another.  The action of connecting patches is how logic flows through your Vizor program, and you’ll do so many times while using **Program** mode.

To change the title and description, simply type your own text into the **blue text patches**.  When you click on the **Title Text** or **Description Text** **patches**, you can see arrows appear in the scene.  This is another way of selecting a **3D object**, meaning you can now **move**, **rotate**, or **scale** the text like any other **3D object**. Hide the **patches** (select the **Build** mode button or use **Tab** on the keyboard), then you can click and drag the arrows to position the selected object as you like!

Congratulations!  You just edited and built your first **patch**.  **Patches** are an incredibly powerful way to create application logic through visual programming.  Visual programming is used in real-world applications such as game development, iPhone app development, and more.  We'll connect and edit **patches** to add complexity to your Storycast such as more **objects**, **animation**, **audio**, and **lights**!

  Look familiar? In the above, a game engine named Unreal is using visual programming to check if a score is high enough
