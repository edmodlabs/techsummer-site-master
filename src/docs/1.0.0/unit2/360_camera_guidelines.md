## 360 Camera Guidelines

### Be the tripod.  

When holding the camera, crouch down slightly and hold it at a 45 degree angle in front of you.  The shutter button and one of the camera lenses should be facing you directly.  Keep the camera as upright as possible, it should be perpendicular to the floor and ceiling without any tilt or roll.  

### Beware the circle.  

Imagine a magic circle 4 feet in radius from your camera (bring back those geometry skillz).  Every object or person should be outside of this circle to ensure the image outputs properly without error.

### Light it up.  

The more light the better the image will look.  Turn all lights on and be careful of too many windows.  Better yet, try taking the selfie outside in broad daylight!**  **

### Steady as it goes.  

If you're having trouble keeping the camera steady, try using the provided camera stand and attach it the bottom of the Ricoh Theta.  Instead of holding the camera out, you can crouch next or below to it, and press the shutter button to fire off an image.  

## Uploading Your 360-Selfie

The easiest way to transfer photos once you take them is to connect the Ricoh Theta S to the VR Kit computer via the included USB cable.  When the camera is connected, the computer will recognize it as a USB device. 

Browse to the RICOH THETA S camera device through the Windows File Explorer.  One quick way to do this is clicking the Windows button in the lower left corner of the screen.  Type in “PC” and hit enter to go to “This PC.”  On the left side you should see the RICHOH THETA S as a device.  Click on it, and then double click “Fixed Storage” and then double click once more on “DCIM.”  In this folder should be all of the images stored on the camera device. [theta_OS1.png]

If you're having trouble finding the device, with your teacher's permission you can try downloading the camera software here:

Next, you will transfer all the camera images to the local computer.  Create a local folder (perhaps on the DESKTOP) and name it something like “360Photos.”  Select all the images on the camera copy (right click and “Copy”) and then paste into the folder you created (right click and “Paste”).  Double click an image to examine it in the Windows Photo app.

Before uploading anything, let's make sure you review your image in VR to make sure the world is ready for it.  Make sure you're using the provided VR Kit computer with tethered Oculus Rift.  Drag and drop the image onto the following Vizor project and click the 'Enter VR' button.  Vizor.io is an online platform for creating virtual worlds that you will get to know better in the next lesson.  Now put on your Oculus Rift and look around to view your 360 world!

To share this image with others, click the 'Share' button that appears when you move the mouse over the Vizor project.  This will create a hyperlink that you can use to come back to, or you can post to share with friends.  Make sure to save this link for each image that you want to share!  If you have access to a smartphone, you can also open up the shared link from the phone.  Try moving your phone around to see how the image updates instead of having to click and drag like on the VR Kit computer.  

If your school has access to Facebook, you can upload the photo to Facebook like any other photo.  Facebook will automatically detect it as a 360-degree image and do the rest of the magic.  You can post the images directly to your wall, or to a friend's page.  With your teacher's permission, you can upload your favorite 360-degree selfie thus far to the TechStart Facebook group here:

## The Magic 360 Sauce 

How does the camera magically covert a two-dimensional (2D) image into one that looks seemingly three-dimensional (3D)?  All digital cameras use a camera *lens *and a digital *sensor *to collect light rays from the world.  Your eyeballs for example are really good wide-angle lenses, which can capture up to 130-degrees of the world at once.*  *

Your Ricoh Theta camera uses two 180-degree lenses and combines them to create one 360-degree image.  This process is called *stitching* the image, much like you might stitch multiple pieces of cloth together to create one single piece of clothing.  The two separate lens images will look like this:

<img src="/images/docs/360_images/theta_example_frame.png">


The two lenses on the camera always stay in the same place relative to each other, so the camera stitches the two images together and deletes the duplicate information so it looks like this: 

<img src="/images/docs/360_images/theta_example_stitched_frame.png">

But wait, the image looks wavelike and all distorted, not all like an image from other digital cameras or your smartphone.  That's because it's still a 2D image trying its hardest to be a 3D one.  You may have seen this in dozens of classrooms before, usually flat and hung on a wall in the form of a world map!  But how can something flat actually represent the earth, which is the shape of a sphere?  This is called a *projection map*, and you can think about your 360-degree images the same way.  

<img src="/images/docs/360_images/Equirectangular_projection_SW.jpg">


Although you can view 360-degree images as flat, they look distorted like a world map.  Remember what your Geography teacher taught you about Canada and Greenland looking way bigger on the flat map than they actually are in real life?  This is because we are doing crazy earth origami, turning a flat piece of paper into a more complicated 3D shape.

Here's the previously flat 360-degree image, now projected mapped around a full sphere object:

Looks totally different, right?  Welcome to the world of 360-degree photography! No more worrying about what correct Instagram angle to capture, just collect a whole scene with one click of the Ricoh Theta and then let the viewer decide where to look!  

## Illusions of Scale

When viewing your 360-degree images in a VR headset, you might have noticed that it looks and feels different than viewing it on a computer screen.  That's because the image is tricking your brain to do what your eyeballs normally do: perceive the world.  One big part of this process is called *scale*.  Depending on how tall you are, you perceive the world as scaled to your current height.  But have you ever felt like a giant when looking at a dollhouse?  Or tiny when looking at an enormous tree?  These are all examples of scale, like how in optical illusion we can trick you into thinking one object is bigger than another.  See here, where the two objects of the same size look different:

<img src="/images/docs/360_images/optical_illusion.jpg">

To see how this works for yourself, let's manipulate scale in VR.  Take three 360-degree images with your Ricoh Theta from the following heights:  

1. From the ground or table surface.  Place object props of different sizes and distance around the camera, such as markers or books.  Don't worry about the 4 feet rule here, this is an experiment.  
2. From your normal eye height.  Use the crouch technique to hold the camera like you learned earlier.  
3. From way high up.  Hold the camera directly above your head as high as it can go.  Make sure to be in either a large room or outside.  

Now, compare all three images in VR with your Oculus Rift using the same process with Vizor.  They might make the world feel different, like you're a tiny bug on the ground or a huge basketball player.  The world should feel bigger in the first case and smaller in the last one.  Scale matters in VR because your eyes are confused with the image it sees.  When creating 360-degree images, the general best-practice is to keep it at an average eye height to make your viewers feel most comfortable.  Feel free to experiment creatively here with different heights or surfaces yourself to see how they feel in an Oculus Rift.  Here are some example:
