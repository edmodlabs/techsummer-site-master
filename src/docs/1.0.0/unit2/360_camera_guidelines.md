360 cameras are very different from normal cameras and have their own guidelines. Let's cover the most important points!

## Camera Tips

### Be the tripod.  

When holding the camera, crouch down slightly. The shutter button and one of the camera lenses should be facing you directly. Keep the camera as upright as possible; don't tilt or roll the camera sideways.  

### Beware the circle.  

Every object or person should be outside of a magic circle 4 feet in radius from your camera to ensure the image outputs properly without error.

### Light it up.  

Images outside in daylight will look best, but if using the camera inside turn on as many lights as possible and avoid large windows that can overexpose the image.

	The Ricoh Theta has an option to work remotely from a smartphone.  TechStart does not supply one, but if you have access to a smartphone and would like to remotely use the camera, you can by following the next two steps.

  	<li>Setup the camera on your camera stand so you can take pictures from afar! </li>
  </ul>

## Illusions of Scale
Virtual reality tricks your brain.  Your eyeballs work hard to perceive the world at a certain *scale*. Sometimes your brain is wrong, like with an optical illusion.  Check out this image. Do the objects look like different sizes?

Initially they do, but if you look closely they are the same size.  Scale matters in virtual reality because we can play with these tricks of scale.

  	<strong>Try It Yourself!</strong>

	Time to play with scale using 360 images. Use the camera to take the following three types of images then continue to the next section.
  <ul> 
  	<li><strong>Giant World:</strong> Snap an image at ground or table level with a few objects around it. Try objects of different shapes and sizes. </li>
  	<li><strong>Normal World:</strong> Snap an image at your normal eye height.  Grab a few friends to pose around the camera! </li>
  	<li><strong>Tiny World:</strong> Snap an image as high as you can safely get the camera by holding it above your head. Don't drop the camera! </li>
  </ul>
