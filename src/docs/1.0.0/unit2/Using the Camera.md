# A 360 World Starter Project


## Hello 360 World!

Let's jump right in to make your first 360-degree image.  You're going to not only learn how to capture a scene, but you're going to be partly in it, too.  Get ready to take your first 360-degree selfie! 

Grab the Ricoh Theta S camera that was included in the VR Starter Kit.  Unpack the pieces from the box  if it hasn't been already and locate the following pieces:

* Ricoh Theta S Camera
* USB Cable
* Camera Case
* User guide

The camera will work out of the box, but should be charged as soon as possible.  Always charge the camera while not in use.  Now, let's learn how to make 360 magic! 

### 1. Press the power button.

Take a few test shots to get a feel for how the camera works and sounds (check out that funky sound effect).  Next, with your teacher's permission, set your class and friends up for a group selfie!  Make sure to try and use the following best-use camera guidelines.
