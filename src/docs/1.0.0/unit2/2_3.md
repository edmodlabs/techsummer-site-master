## Overview
Let's explore the structure of a Storycast.

## Scene Structure
Good storytelling is a steady pace of answering questions, while raising further ones.  In the previous activity, you learned how plot moves through anecdotes and reflection.  In a Storycast, the plot uses a three scene Vizor project with a clear beginning, middle, and end.  In all previous activities, you worked in Vizor projects with a single scene.  Now, you will juggle multiple scenes to create story <i>structure</i>.  Each scene will be populated with the world and characters you envision for your Storycast.

    <strong>Try It Out</strong>
  </div> 
  Experience the **3D Story template** by using the following hyperlink on your smartphone: https://vizor.io/techsummer/storycast. To interact with a Vizor project while viewing in VR, you need to tap the phoneâ€™s screen.  Look at the **Next** buttons and tap the screen to progress the story.

## Creating Your Workspace
Now we need to get you set up to use the **Storycast template**.

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <strong>Create Your Project</strong>
  </div> 
  On your computer, **edit** and **duplicate** the **Storycast template**. You will be using the template as the base for the remainder of your Storycast activities.  Remember, you save your project by **publishing**.

Now let's check out how to navigate scenes.  Each scene has its own 3D objects, which can be replaced and adjusted.  To help with navigating the scenes in the Vizor editor, there are keyboard shortcuts for each scene.  You can use the hotkeys **J**, **K**, **L**, and **P** to change the active scene in the Vizor editor.

  Use J/K/L/P to switch scenes while editing Vizor projects on your computer.

    <strong>Computer vs Phone</strong>
  </div> 
  Remember: you use your computer to build Vizor projects and your phone to view projects with your viewer. So, on your computer, you use the **J**, **K**, **L**, and **P** keys to change the scene you are viewing.
