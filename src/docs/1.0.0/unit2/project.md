## Lesson Plan + Skill Mappings

* Can we tie to ESSA, CC, or other mappings educators are comfortable with?
* Possible cores:
    * Physics: light optics, digital photography
    * Math: projection mapping
    * Geography: world maps and projection mapping

## Project Prompt and Goals

Get ready to jump into the field of 360-degree panoramic photography!  By the end of the project, you will:

* Understand how 360-degree panoramas work and how they differ from other types of images.
* Use a 360-degree panoramic camera called the Ricoh Theta S to capture images.
* Upload your captured panormams from the camera and view them online or in an Oculus Rift VR device.

Requirements

* This lesson is designed to be completed by a single student, ideally the designated TechStart Innovator.
* Ricoh Theta S
* Camera stand

## Capturing The World in 360

Digital cameras work by taking a piece of the world and converting it into digital image data.  This process is called *capture, *which uses a camera *lens *and digital *sensor *to collect light rays from the world.  The camera lens can also use different types of glass to distort the captured image as either *narrow *or *wide.  *

For example, many skater videos use super wide lenses, also called a *fisheye lens*, to capture more of the action!

Others images, like in dreaded school portraits, use narrow lenses to make sure all close features are accurate!

In both cases the camera device is the same, but the different lens changes how much of the world is captured.  This is called the *field-of-view* (FOV) for a captured image.  However, even one super wide lens at most can only capture 180-degree FOV of a scene.  Much like our eyes can capture only 180-degrees at any moment!

In order to capture an entire 360-degree image, most special cameras require the use of two *fisheye *lenses that are aligned back to back on the camera.  This is how your Ricoh Theta S camera works, which is included in your Techstart VR Kit.  Cameras that take multiple wide images like this must be combined to create one uniform image.  This process is called *stitching* the image, much like you might stitch multiple pieces of cloth together to create clothes!  This process is explained next.

## Stitching: The 360 Secret Sauce

When a camera like the Ricoh Theta S captures two wide angle images, they need to be stitched together to make one continuous panorama image.  Two source images from a 360-degree camera might look like this:

[image1]
[image2]

 In order to combine them, the camera needs to know where to match them up and how to distort the image.  It looks for *overlap *areas in both images that share the same information.  Intelligent software can then align them and do the manual work of removing duplicated images.  This works for more than two images, and smartphone apps are using similar processes to make stitching fast for even dozens of images!  Check it out:

Once the camera or software is able to stitch all of the captured images into one complete 360-degree panorama, how do you actually view it?  Follow along to find out!  

## Watching the World in 360

It might be weird to imagine, but a 360-degree panorama is still a flat image.  It's meant to wrap around a spherical shape to look correct.  You've probably already seen one of these  already in the form of a world map!

You've seen them in dozens of classrooms before, usually flat and hung on a wall.  But how can something flat actually represent the earth, which is the shape of a sphere?  This is called a *projection map*, and you can think about 360-degree panoramas the same way.  

Although you can view 360-degree panoramas as flat images, they are distorted as a projection map to wrap around a sphere.  This is basically like crazy earth origami, where your flat piece of paper turns into a more complicated shape:

Take the following flat panoramic image, for example:

Now look at that same image, mapped around in a full sphere.  You can click your mouse and drag to move the image:

Looks totally different, right?  That's because you're using a window to view only part of the full 360-degree panorama sphere.  This is called a *VR camera *and will be explained further in the next Starter Project lesson (link).  For now, just remember that people will almost always look at your 360-degree images or videos in this way.  By choosing where to move the window, viewers can change what part of the panorama they see.  This is why 360-degree imagery is so exciting, they let the viewer choose where to go!  You might even see these on Facebook now, as people start to create more 360-degree content.  

## Hello 360 World!

Enough math and geography talk.  Time to start making your own 360-degree image selfie.  That's right, you're going to not only learn how to capture a scene, but you're going to be in it, too.  Get ready to take your first 360-degree panoramic selfie! 

Grab the Ricoh Theta S camera that was included in the VR Starter Kit.  Unpack the pieces from the box and you should find the following:

* Ricoh Theta S Camera
* USB Cable
* Camera Case
* User guide

The camera should work fine out of the box without charging it, but make sure to use the included USB cable to charge it when not in use.  Now, let's learn how to make 360 magic with it! 

Press the power button.

Make sure the camera is in photo mode.

Press the shutter button to snap a pic!

Take a few test shots to get a feel for how the camera works and sounds.  Next, with your teacher's permission, set your class up for a group selfie!  Hold the camera up above you while pointing the one of the lenses at you, while the rest of the class stands around in a circle.  Always remember to try and follow the best use guidelines:

1. Keep the camera as upright as possible
2. Try to keep close objects away from the sides of the camera to make sure stitching is clean
3. Create as much light as possible in the scene, perhaps even taking the selfie outside
4. Use the included tripod for extra stability

See the following example selfie for inspiration!

Uploading Your 360 Selfie

The easiest way to transfer photos is to connect the Ricoh Theta S to the VR Kit computer via the included USB cable.  When the camera is connected, the computer will recognize it as a USB device.  You can browse the camera device through the File Explorer to find the DCIM folder.  This folder will contain all of the photos taken on the camera.  You can then copy and paste the photos to a local folder on the computer.  If that doesn't work, with your teacher's permission you can download the camera software here:

https://theta360.com/intl/support/download/pcapp/windows

Once you have the 360-degree images copied to the computer, you can upload them to the internet for viewing.  If your school has access to Facebook, you can upload the photo to Facebook like any other photo.  Facebook will automatically detect it as a 360-degree image and do the rest of the magic.  With your teacher's permission, upload your selfie to the TechStart group here:
