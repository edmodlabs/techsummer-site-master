## Overview
In this activity and the next, the difficulty increases as we learn to use <i>visual programming</i>.  If the activity gets frustrating or difficult,  don’t give up!  There is a community to help!  You can attend office hours or post in the [Facebook group](fb.com/groups/techsummer) if you are stuck.

The challenge of visual programming is worthwhile. Although visual programming is tricky at first, you'll eventually be able to create animations, interactions, and more!

## Vizor Modes
There are two modes of creation in Vizor: **Build** and **Program**.  In **Build** mode, you’ll build the visuals of a scene.  In **Program** mode, you’ll jump into the program that handles your scene’s **objects** and **behaviors**.  So far, you have been creating in only **Build** mode.  To switch between the modes, click on the buttons in the toolbar or press **Tab** on your keyboard.

</div>

Once in **Program** mode, you will see visual blocks, each of which is called a **patch**.  **Patches** are building blocks which represent objects, interactions, behaviors and more in your project.  Behind the scenes, everything in Vizor is a **patch**!  **Patches** are an example of visual programming, an approach where you write programs using visual blocks rather than text.  Let’s break down how things work under the Vizor hood!

    <strong>Patch Types</strong>
  </div> 
  Each patch has a different color depending on what the patch can do. We will not use every color of patch, but here is a breakdown if you are curious.
  <ul>
    <li>Yellow patches are <i>comments</i>. Add comments so you and others easily understand what your program is doing.</li>
    <li>Blue and gray patches are default Vizor patches you can use to pick values (numbers, colors, etc), do operations (such as addition), and so on.</li>
    <li>Purple patches are nested patches. These contain more patches inside.</li>
    <li>Orange patches are outputs. They output values from nested patches.</li>
    <li>Green patches are <i>variables</i> you can use to share information across your program.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Navigating Storycast Patches
In **Program** mode, you should see **patches** for all Storycast scenes: **Title Scene**, **Beginning Scene**, **Middle Scene**, and **End Scene**. Purple patches are **nested patches** because they contain more patches inside (patch inception!).

To look inside one of the scenes, click on the **edit** button (the **pencil icon**) on the **nested patch**.

  Click the pencil icon to enter a nested patch
</div>
<br>

You can navigate the layers of your **patches** using the **Breadcrumb** at the top right corner of the screen. The **Root** is the base level of all of your **patches**.

You might be wondering: why in the world use **nested patches**? We like to use **nested patches** for the same reason you use folders on a computer, different pockets on your jeans, and so on. If everything was in one place, we would get confused and lose our things very quickly. **Nested patches** are a great way to stay organized and we use the **Breadcrumb** to jump back and forth between **patch** levels.

    <strong>Practice Navigation</strong>
  </div> 
  To make sure you understand part one of the patches intro, let's do a navigation test. Complete the following before you proceed.
  <ul>
    <li>Find the <strong>patch</strong> for your Storycast <strong>Title Scene</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>nested patch</strong>.</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>Breadcrumb</strong> to go back to your <strong>Root</strong> level.</li>
    <li>Repeat the above for the <strong>Beginning Scene</strong>, <strong>Middle Scene</strong> and <strong>End Scene</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
