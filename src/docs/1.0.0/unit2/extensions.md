## Illusions of Scale

When viewing your 360-degree images in a VR headset, you might have noticed that it looks and feels different than viewing it on a computer screen.  That's because the image is tricking your brain to do what your eyeballs normally do: perceive the world.  One big part of this process is called *scale*.  Depending on how tall you are, you perceive the world as scaled to your current height.  But have you ever felt like a giant when looking at a dollhouse?  Or tiny when looking at an enormous tree?  These are all examples of scale, like how in optical illusion we can trick you into thinking one object is bigger than another.  See here, where the two objects of the same size look different:

To see how this works for yourself, let's manipulate scale in VR.  Take three 360-degree images with your Ricoh Theta from the following heights:  

1. From the ground or table surface.  Place object props of different sizes and distance around the camera, such as markers or books.  Don't worry about the 4 feet rule here, this is an experiment.  
2. From your normal eye height.  Use the crouch technique to hold the camera like you learned earlier.  
3. From way high up.  Hold the camera directly above your head as high as it can go.  Make sure to be in either a large room or outside.  

Now, compare all three images in VR with your Oculus Rift using the same process with Vizor.  They might make the world feel different, like you're a tiny bug on the ground or a huge basketball player.  The world should feel bigger in the first case and smaller in the last one.  Scale matters in VR because your eyes are confused with the image it sees.  When creating 360-degree images, the general best-practice is to keep it at an average eye height to make your viewers feel most comfortable.  Feel free to experiment creatively here with different heights or surfaces yourself to see how they feel in an Oculus Rift.  Here are some example:
