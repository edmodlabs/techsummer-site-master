## Uploading Your 360-Selfie

The easiest way to transfer photos once you take them is to connect the Ricoh Theta S to the VR Kit computer via the included USB cable.  When the camera is connected, the computer will recognize it as a USB device. 

Browse to the RICOH THETA S camera device through the Windows File Explorer.  One quick way to do this is clicking the Windows button in the lower left corner of the screen.  Type in “PC” and hit enter to go to “This PC.”  On the left side you should see the RICHOH THETA S as a device.  Click on it, and then double click “Fixed Storage” and then double click once more on “DCIM.”  In this folder should be all of the images stored on the camera device. [theta_OS1.png]

If you're having trouble finding the device, with your teacher's permission you can try downloading the camera software here:

Next, you will transfer all the camera images to the local computer.  Create a local folder (perhaps on the DESKTOP) and name it something like “360Photos.”  Select all the images on the camera copy (right click and “Copy”) and then paste into the folder you created (right click and “Paste”).  Double click an image to examine it in the Windows Photo app.

Before uploading anything, let's make sure you review your image in VR to make sure the world is ready for it.  Make sure you're using the provided VR Kit computer with tethered Oculus Rift.  Drag and drop the image onto the following Vizor project and click the 'Enter VR' button.  Vizor.io is an online platform for creating virtual worlds that you will get to know better in the next lesson.  Now put on your Oculus Rift and look around to view your 360 world!

To share this image with others, click the 'Share' button that appears when you move the mouse over the Vizor project.  This will create a hyperlink that you can use to come back to, or you can post to share with friends.  Make sure to save this link for each image that you want to share!  If you have access to a smartphone, you can also open up the shared link from the phone.  Try moving your phone around to see how the image updates instead of having to click and drag like on the VR Kit computer.  

If your school has access to Facebook, you can upload the photo to Facebook like any other photo.  Facebook will automatically detect it as a 360-degree image and do the rest of the magic.  You can post the images directly to your wall, or to a friend's page.  With your teacher's permission, you can upload your favorite 360-degree selfie thus far to the TechStart Facebook group here:
