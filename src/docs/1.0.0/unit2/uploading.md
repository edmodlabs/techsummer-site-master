Time to view your 360 images!

## Viewing Your 360 Worlds 

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Try It Yourself!</strong> 
  </div>
  Before we begin, download and install the <a href='https://theta360.com/intl/support/download/pcapp/windows'>Ricoh Theta S software</a>.
  <ul> 
  	<li>Use the included USB cable to connect the camera to the VR-ready computer.</li>
    <div style="text-align:center">
      <img src="/images/docs/360_images/theta_connect_USB.jpg" width="75%" height="75%">
    </div>
	  <li>When prompted, select "Open the device for display". Save the image files you want to view onto the computer. Use a location you will be able to find easily.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

If you're having trouble finding the camera device, with your teacher's permission you can try downloading the [camera software](https://theta360.com/intl/support/download/pcapp/windows) to make the process easier.

Now, let's view the images!

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Try It Yourself!</strong> 
  </div>
  For each image you want to view, complete the following on the VR-ready computer.
  <ul> 
  	<li>Open the Vizor [360 image viewer](http://360.vizor.io/). </li>
  	<li>Drag and drop the image you want to view into the window. </li>
  	<li>Click "Enter VR" and put on the Oculus Rift. </li>
  </ul>
</div>

How did the three images of different heights look and feel? After viewing them in an Oculus Rift, you should have a better idea of how scale works in virtual reality.
