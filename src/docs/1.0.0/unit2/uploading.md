Time to view your 360 images!

## Viewing Your 360 Worlds 

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Try It Yourself!</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	First, we need to copy the images from the camera to your computer.
  	<li>Connect the Ricoh Theta S to the Techstart VR computer via the included USB cable. </li>
  	<li>Browse to the RICOH THETA S camera device through the Windows File Explorer. </li>
  	<li>Double click on the "RICOH THETA S" folder.</li>
  	<li>Double click on "Fixed Storage" folder inside of the "RICOH THETA S" folder. </li>
	  <li>Double click on "DCIM" folder inside of the "RICOH THETA S" folder. The folder contains all images stored on the camera. </li>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		<img src="/images/docs/360_images/theta_OS1.png">
	</div>
	<li>Transfer all the camera images to your computer. </li>
  </ul>
</div>

If you're having trouble finding the camera device, with your teacher's permission you can try downloading the [camera software](https://theta360.com/intl/support/download/pcapp/windows) to make the process easier.

Now, let's view the images!

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Try It Yourself!</strong> 
  </div>
  For each image you want to view, complete the following on the TechStart VR computer.
  <ul> 
  	<li>Open the Vizor [360 image viewer](http://360.vizor.io/). </li>
  	<li>Drag and drop the image you want to view into the window. </li>
  	<li>Click "Enter VR" and put on the Oculus Rift. </li>
  </ul>
</div>

How did the three images of different heights look and feel? After viewing them in an Oculus Rift, you should have a better idea of how scale works in virtual reality.
