To share any of your images, click the 'Share' button (represented by a big, curved arrow) in Vizor.  This will create a URL you can send so anyone can view your image from a smartphone or computer. You could share with the world!

You can also share on Facebook. Facebook will automatically detect your image as a 360 image and do the rest of the magic. You can post the images directly to your wall, or to a friend's page.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've completed your first 360 project. Now's a great time to review what you learned so far:
* How to use a 360 camera called the Ricoh Theta S to capture images.
* How 360 camera position effects scale in VR.
* How to upload your captured images from the camera to view in a VR headset and online in a browser.

Stay tuned for more projects from TechStart. Next up, we plan to create projects that use 360 video and add graphics to 360 images.
