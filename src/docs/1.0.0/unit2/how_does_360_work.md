To share any of your images, click the 'Share' button in Vizor.  This will create a URL you can send to others. Send the link to a friend and they can open up the link from a smartphone or another computer browser to see your image!

If your school has access to Facebook and you have your teacher's permission, you can also post the images. Facebook will automatically detect your image as a 360-degree image and do the rest of the magic. You can post the images directly to your wall, or to a friend's page.
