## Overview
Dive into the key elements of a story's plot.

## Plot
Thus far, we have the storytelling tools of scale, world, and character.  But how do we create narrative in order to drive our story forward?  A <i>plot</i> is a series of events over time that connect to a world and a character to create a meaningful story.  In a Vizor Storycast, creating plot from 3D objects is tricky so we will be using a narrator voice over to explain the actions of each Vizor scene.  Let’s see how this shakes out next.

The lab world is compelling to look at, but there isn’t a whole lot of explained action.  There’s a clear world and characters, but these cannot create a story alone.

Now we’re talking (literally)!  By adding a simple <i>voice over</i> (VO), we have more of a story.  Each line from a narrator is called an <i>anecdote</i> and drives the plot forward.  One anecdote tells us the robot has been plotting against the scientist.  The next anectdote tells us the rocket is ready.  The last anectdote reveals something bigger: the robot wants to go home!  The last anecdote is the most important, because it answers the story's “so what” for the character.  The robot is having a moment of <i>reflection</i>.  What makes most stories meaningful is when characters experience powerful moments of reflection.
