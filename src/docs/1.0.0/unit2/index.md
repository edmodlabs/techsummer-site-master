## Overview

At the end of Unit 1, we learned Vizor fundamentals and how scale effects storytelling. Now it's time to generate story ideas! 

## Ideation

Most stories on every medium (books, movies, and games) are all built by constructing <i>world</i> and <i>character</i>.  A world is the environment and set of rules the story universe takes places in, like a mad science lab with futuristic technology.  A character is a central object inside that world capable of making decisions, like a dog or a penguin.  In Vizor, you use 3D objects to populate both the world and characters of your Storycast.  

To brainstorm ideas for your Storycast, we will borrow a technique from Pixar called the <i>“what if”</i> game.  In this game, you come up with a “what if” question that involves both a world and a character.  For example, what if toys came alive while humans weren’t looking?  What if a fish got lost in the ocean?  What if it was a job for monsters to scare humans?  In each question, there should be a clear world and character involved.

  	<strong>What If?</strong>
  </div> 
  Come up with at least 5 “what if” questions for your Storycast idea.  Remember both the world and the character will have to be built in Vizor, so browse the objects available for inspiration on worlds and characters to use.

  Turn the “what if” idea you are most excited about into a [meme](https://memegenerator.net/) and post it to the [Facebook group](fb.com/groups/techsummer)!
