A 360 video is created with a camera system that simultaneously records all 360 degrees of a scene. Viewers can pan and rotate a 360 video’s perspective to watch it from different angles. By using the included Ricoh Theta S 360 camera and following the steps below, any classroom can capture 360 film  and consume it in virtual reality.

# Viewing your 360 video on the Oculus Rift
Use the Oculus Video application to view your 360 video.


## Labeling your 360 video files
* For your 360 video to be compatible with Oculus, add "_360" to the end of your file name.

Example: If your video file was MyCoolVideo.mp4, label it as MyCoolVideo_360.mp4.
**Make sure that the file extension is mp4 (lowercase) and not MP4 (uppercase)**

* Once you label your files, you can transfer them to the videos folder in your Windows System drive.

## Transferring 360 video to Oculus Video
* Open your Windows System drive (this is generally your C: drive).
* Open the Users folder.
* Select your user profile.
* Locate and open the Videos folder and move your videos here.
* The next time you launch Oculus Video, your videos will automatically appear in the “My Videos” section. If you do not see it, please check the instructions and try again.
