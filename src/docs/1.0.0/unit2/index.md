Welcome to the **360 Image Project**! Read the following details before you get started.

## Project Goals
By the end of the project, you will understand:
* How to use a 360 camera called the Ricoh Theta S to capture images.
* How 360 camera position effects scale in VR.
* How to upload your captured images from the camera to view in a VR headset and online in a browser.

## Requirements
* The project should take approximately 40-60 minutes and is designed to be completed by a single individual, ideally the designated TechStart Student Innovator if you are in a school.
* To view your images, you'll need a computer with VR and WebVR installed. Check the [Installing WebVR](/docs/1.0.0/introduction/installing_web_vr.html) section if you're not sure if your computer is ready.
* Access to a Ricoh Theta S and camera stand.
