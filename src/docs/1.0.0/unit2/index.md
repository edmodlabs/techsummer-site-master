Welcome to the Introduction to 360 Images project! Read the following details before you get started.

## Project Goals
By the end of the project, you will:
* Use a 360-degree camera called the Ricoh Theta S to capture images.
* Understand how 360-degree images work and how they differ from other types of images.
* Upload your captured images from the camera and view them in an Oculus Rift VR device and online in a browser.

## Requirements and Suggestions
* The project should take approximately 40-60 minutes and is designed to be completed by a single student, ideally the designated TechStart Innovator if you are in a school.
* Access to a Ricoh Theta S and camera stand.
