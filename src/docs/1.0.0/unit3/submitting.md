One of the best parts of Vizor is sharing the worlds you build with your friends.

### Publishing
To share your creation, you first need to publish your project.

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Publish Your Project!</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	<li>Click the “Publish” button on the top right of Vizor's editor. </li>
  	<li>Give your project a name. </li>
  	<li>Make your project public. </li>
  	<li>Hit the publish button! </li>
  	<br>
  	Here's a video walk-through of the steps above.

  </ul>
</div>

When you complete the above, you'll be taken to a website with the URL of **vizor.io/(your username)/(your project name)**. If your username is “techstart” and your project name is “TheEmptyDesert” the URL would be vizor.io/techstart/TheEmptyDesert.

You can view, edit and delete your projects at **vizor.io/(your username)**.

### Viewing

Although you can build Vizor projects on any computer, you'll need a computer or phone with WebVR to view Vizor projects in VR. You can learn more about installation on TechStart's [Installing WebVR](/docs/1.0.0/introduction/installing_web_vr.html) guide.

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <strong>View Your Project!</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
    <li>Open Firefox Nightly on your computer. </li>
    <li>Enter the URL of your published project. </li>
    <li>Click on the screen, and icons should appear near the bottom. </li>
    <li>Click the binoculars icon and put on your headset to try your project in VR! </li>
    <br>
    Here's a video walk-through of the steps above.
