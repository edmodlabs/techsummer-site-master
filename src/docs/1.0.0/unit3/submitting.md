## Share With The World

One of the coolest parts about Vizor is the ability to share what you build with the world. If you want, you can let anyone with a VR headset see what you've built. 

### Publishing
To publish your project, click the “Publish” button in the Vizor editor. A screen should pop up. Give your project a name and hit the “Publish” button to publish your project on the internet. You'll then be taken to a website with the URL of **vizor.io/(your username)/(your project name)**. What's a URL? URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is basically an internet address for where different websites live.

If your username is “techstart” and your project name is “my_project,” the URL for your Vizor project is vizor.io/techstart/my_project. You can view, edit and delete all of your projects by visiting **vizor.io/(your username)** in your browser.

### Viewing

Although you can use Vizor on any computer, you'll need a computer or phone with WebVR to view Vizor projects in virtual reality.

Once you have WebVR and your virtual reality headset ready, open Firefox Nightly on your computer and enter the URL of your published project. If you click near the bottom of the screen, you'll see an icon which looks like binoculars. On the internet, that icon is used to start a VR experience. Click the icon and put the headset on to see what you made in virtual reality!

### After you've completed all steps above and your project is listed at **vizor.io/(your username)**, please complete a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6JF7XLL" target="_blank">3-Minute Survey</a>.
