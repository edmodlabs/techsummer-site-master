## Share With The World

One of the coolest parts about Vizor is the ability to share what you build with anyone. Anyone with a VR headset can see what you've built. 

### Publishing
When you are ready, complete the following to publish your project. 

<div class="alert_blue">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Publish Your Project!</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	<li>Click the “Publish” button on the top right of Vizor's editor. </li>
  	<li>Give your project a name. </li>
  	<li>Make your project public. </li>
  	<li>Hit the publish button! </li>
  	<br>
  	Here's a video guide of the steps above.

  </ul>
</div>

When you complete the above, you'll be taken to a website with the URL of **vizor.io/(your username)/(your project name)**. If your username is “techstart” and your project name is “my_project,” the URL would be vizor.io/techstart/my_project. 

You can view, edit and delete your projects at **vizor.io/(your username)**.

### Viewing

Although you can use Vizor on any computer, you'll need a computer or phone with WebVR to view Vizor projects in virtual reality.

Once you have WebVR and your virtual reality headset ready, open Firefox Nightly on your computer and enter the URL of your published project. If you click near the bottom of the screen, you'll see an icon which looks like binoculars. On the internet, that icon is used to start a VR experience. Click the icon and put the headset on to see what you made in virtual reality!

### After you've completed all steps above and your project is listed at **vizor.io/(your username)**, please complete a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6JF7XLL" target="_blank">3-Minute Survey</a>.
