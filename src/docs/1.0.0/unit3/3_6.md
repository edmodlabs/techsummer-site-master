## Overview
We're going to discuss and test a very important concept for any engineering or computer science project: performance.

## What is Performance?
Anytime you add an object to your Vizor project, it affects your applicationâ€™s performance.  <i>Performance</i> refers to the efficiency and speed of a computer program.  If a device has ever stalled or a web page took forever to load, you experienced programs showing poor performance.

In CG and virtual reality, much of performance is measured by <i>frames per second</i> (FPS). FPS is the number of times an application can update the screen per second. You might not realize it, but even the screen you are viewing right now is being updated multiple times per second!

  		<strong>Visualizing FPS</strong>
  	</div> 
  	To visually see FPS in action, check out this [resource](www.testufo.com/framerates#count=4&background=stars&pps=720).  Notice how the UFO moving at 60 FPS looks smoother than the UFO moving at 7 FPS.  Higher FPS numbers lead to more comfortable experiences, especially in VR.

With VR applications like Vizor, FPS matters much more than on a computer monitor because your eyes are closer to the screen.  If the FPS drops down to say 7 FPS, you'll start to notice the experience lag and could get sick.

  		<strong>The (FP)Struggle is Real</strong>
  	</div> 
  	See low FPS in action by trying our [laggy project example](https://patches.vizor.io/techsummer/lag) on your smartphone in your viewer.  The scene is a complex combination of 3D objects, lighting, and animations.  Every element contributes to the overall poor application performance.

  		<strong>A Hint of What's Ahead</strong>
  	</div> 
	Tap your smartphone while looking at the rockets in VR Mode on your VR viewer.  They move and the shadows change! We'll cover animations in a later section.

Poor performance can only be fixed by removing too many scene objects or patches.  Animations and lighting affect performance the most, so we will learn to use them in a Storycast wisely in Unit 4.
