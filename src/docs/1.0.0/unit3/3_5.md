## Overview
The <strong>Media Browser</strong> you used in the last activity can handle both image and audio files.  In this activity, you will learn how to add and mix audio into your Storycast, including both audio narration and background music.

## Own the Mic
First, we will need to record a few audio files to upload to the <strong>Media Browser</strong>.  The Ricoh Theta S camera also doubles as a great microphone.  To use the camera to record audio, switch it to <i>Video Mode</i> by pressing the <i>Toggle Mode</i> button on the side of the camera.  Use the <i>Shutter Button</i> to now start and stop video recording.

  		<strong>Set Up</strong>
  	</div> 
  	Grab the current version of your scratch script and find a quiet place to record audio.  Sit close to the top of the camera where the mic is.  Read each script section out loud, using the camera shutter button to start and stop recording.  You want to have three separate files, so make sure to record each script section separately.  Go slow here and speak carefully.  The tendency is always to rush through words faster than you need.

## Sound Mixing
Copy the video files off the camera to your computer using the same process as the 360 photo activity.  You can sort through and listen to the files to find the three best if you recorded more than three.  

The video files are in .MP4 format, which is a common video compression.  We only want the audio data, not the video.  To do that we need to <i>convert</i> them into the .MP3 format using an online converter.  

<div class="alert_yellow">
  	Your Ricoh Theta S camera can film 360 videos.  The project does not cover 360 videos, but you can learn more on the [Ricoh Theta website](https://theta360.com/en/support/story/s/settings/?type=videos)

To start the audio conversion process, go to the [Online Convert website](http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-mp3)

<div class="alert_green">
	<div style="text-align:center">
  		<strong>Convert Files</strong>
  	</div> 
  	Select Choose File and select the first .MP4 video file.  Select the Convert File button and it will process automatically, and then download it back in the proper .MP3 audio format.  Magic!  Repeat this process with all three video files.

In order to mix audio into your Storycast, you will need to use an <strong>Audio Control nested patch</strong>.  In your Vizor Storycast project, switch to <strong>Program Mode</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Root</strong> scene.  Select the edit button to go inside the <strong>Audio Control nested patch</strong>. Here you will see three more nested patches for music files, and three nested patches for audio voice over files.

Each patch corresponds to the Beginning, Middle, or End scenes for both music and narration.

  		<strong>Add Audio</strong>
  	</div> 
  	Add the first voice audio to your scene by selecting <strong>Source</strong> under the <strong>Beginning Scene Narration patch</strong>.   The <strong>Media Browser</strong> will appear.  Select the <strong>Upload Tab</strong> and hit <strong>Browse</strong> to locate the beginning scene .MP3 audio file on your computer.  After the file uploads, the menu switches back to the <strong>Browse Tab</strong>.  Select the <strong>OK</strong> button to confirm the file choice. Repeat the steps above for the <strong>Middle Scene</strong> and <strong>End Scene</strong>.

  	Test your audio files are working by <strong>publishing</strong> your project and viewing in your VR viewer with your smartphone.  Audio files and converting can be tricky, so don’t hesitate to reach out if they’re not working!
</div>

Changing background music for scenes works the same way.  There is default music included for each scene, but you can upload and change the music in the <strong>Audio Control patch</strong>.  Change the <strong>Source</strong> for each of the <strong>Beginning Scene</strong>, <strong>Middle Scene</strong>, or <strong>End Scene Music patches</strong> using the <strong>Media Browser</strong> for any .MP3 file.  

<div class="alert_yellow">
  	[Freesound](freesound.org) is a good place to find royalty free music and other audio for your project. The default music in the template is from there.  If you have other music software and would like to mix your own music files (like in Garageband) feel free to do so!  Make sure to always convert it to the .MP3 format.
