## Overview
The <strong>Media Browser</strong> you used in the last activity can handle both image and audio files.  In this activity, you will learn how to add and mix audio into your Storycast, including both audio narration and background music.

## Own the Mic
First, we will need to record a few audio files to upload to the <strong>Media Browser</strong>.  The Ricoh Theta S camera also doubles as a great microphone.  To use the camera to record audio, switch it to <i>Video Mode</i> by pressing the <i>Toggle Mode</i> button on the side of the camera.  Use the <i>Shutter Button</i> to now start and stop video recording.

  	Grab the current version of your scratch script and find a quiet place to record audio.  Sit close to the top of the camera where the mic is.  Read each script section out loud, using the camera shutter button to start and stop recording.  You want to have three separate files, so make sure to record each script section separately.  Go slow here and speak carefully.  The tendency is always to rush through words faster than you need.

## Sound Mixing
Copy the video files off the camera to your computer using the same process as the 360 photo activity.  You can sort through and listen to the files to find the three best if you recorded more than three.  

The video files are in .MP4 format, which is a common video compression.  We only want the audio data, not the video.  To do that we need to <i>convert</i> them into the .MP3 format using an online converter.

  	Your Ricoh Theta S camera is capable of filming 360 videos, similar to the photos you took.  This project does not cover 360 videos, but you can learn more on the [Ricoh Theta site](https://theta360.com/en/support/story/s/settings/?type=videos)
