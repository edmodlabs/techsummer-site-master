Welcome to the **Vizor Starter Project**! Read the following details before you get started.

## Project Goals
Jump into building worlds with VR! By the end of the project, you will understand:
* How computer graphics and VR can be used to create digital experiences.
* How to use a platform named Vizor to build a virtual world you can share with anyone.
* Key tips on designing virtual worlds from engineers at Facebook.

Below is an example of what you'll build. Hit play, then click and drag to look around. Later, you'll be able to dive into worlds like the one below using VR!

Below are projects that use code to build interactive experiences. To build these types of projects, complete this project then explore Vizor's [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0Qt-QS9kmTNhmYOMOvy0XMyvzdAdFnX) and [written](https://blog.vizor.io/) tutorials.

You can view more projects on the [Vizor homepage](https://patches.vizor.io/).

## Requirements
* The project is designed to be completed by individual students, not teams, and should take 40-60 minutes.
* Vizor is most easily used with a mouse.
* Vizor projects are most exciting in VR! To use VR with Vizor, you'll need a computer that supports WebVR. Check the [Installing WebVR](/docs/1.0.0/introduction/installing_web_vr.html) section for more information.

  <strong>Warning:</strong> if your editor ever looks like the image below, you are in Vizor's "Patches" mode and should hit "Tab" on your keyboard to exit. Patches add programming to your world and will be explained in later projects.

## Project Background

Vizor and VR use computer graphics, also known as CG. CG is a field of computer science used to create art, models, animations, films, and more. The project will introduce you to some CG basics, which are used in applications beyond VR.

  If you want to see the world you create in VR, make sure your computer supports WebVR. Otherwise, you can create your project and use a VR-ready computer to view in VR later. Click the button below to dive in!
