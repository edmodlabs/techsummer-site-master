## Project Goals
Get ready to jump into the world of virtual reality (VR) development! We will not focus on code until later projects, but the project will introduce you to VR design. By the end of the project, you will:
* Get a first taste of how computer graphics can be used to create any world you can imagine.
* Use a platform named Vizor to build a virtual world you can share with anyone.
* See hands-on examples of how to design virtual worlds from engineers at Facebook.

Want an idea of what you'll be able to build? Check out the following project built by someone else in Vizor. You can click and drag to change your view!

## Requirements and Suggestions

* The Virtual Reality Starter Project is designed to be completed by individual students, not teams.
* Similar to many computer graphics platforms, Vizor is most easily used with a mouse.
* Vizor projects are most exciting in VR! To use VR with Vizor, you'll need one computer set up with WebVR.

## Computer Graphics and VR 

Computer graphics, also known as CG, is a field of computer science which uses computers to create pictures, models, films, and more. CG emerged in the United States in the 1950's and since then has been used for many applications.

With a knowledge of computer graphics you can...

* use an image editing program like PhotoShop!

* build 3-dimensional (3D) models and animations using a program like Blender!

* create movies, video games, and more using computer programs such as Adobe Final Cut, Unity or Unreal, and more!

Computer graphics is also the basis of building virtual reality experiences!
