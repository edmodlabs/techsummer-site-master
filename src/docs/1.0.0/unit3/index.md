## Project Goals
Let's jump into the world of VR development! By the end of the project, you will:
* See how computer graphics and VR can be used to create anything you can imagine.
* Use a platform named Vizor to build a virtual world you can share with anyone.
* See hands-on tips on how to design virtual worlds from engineers at Facebook.

Here's an example of what you'll build. Hit play, then click and drag to look around.

## Requirements and Suggestions

* The project is designed to be completed by individual students, not teams.
* Vizor is most easily used with a mouse.
* Vizor projects are most exciting in VR! To use VR with Vizor, you'll need a computer with VR installed and WebVR installed.

  <strong>Warning! If your editor ever looks like the below, you have entered Vizor's "Patches" mode and you must hit "Tab" on your keyboard to exit. Patches mode allows you to add programming to your project and will be explained in later projects.</strong>

## Vizor, VR, and Computer Graphics 

Vizor and VR use computer graphics, also known as CG. CG is a field of computer science used to create art, models, animations, films, and more. The project will introduce you to some CG basics, which are used in applications beyond VR.
