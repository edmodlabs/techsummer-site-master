Welcome to the **Vizor Starter Project**! Read the following details before you get started.

## Project Goals
Let's jump into the world of VR development! If you complete the whole project, you will understand:
* How computer graphics and VR can be used to create digital experiences.
* How to use a platform named Vizor to build a virtual world you can share with anyone.
* Key tips on designing virtual worlds from engineers at Facebook.

Here's an example of what you'll build. Hit play, then click and drag to look around.

## Requirements
* The project is designed to be completed by individual students, not teams, and should take 40-60 minutes.
* Vizor is most easily used with a mouse.
* Vizor projects are most exciting in VR! To use VR with Vizor, you'll need a computer with VR and WebVR installed. Check the [Installing WebVR](/docs/1.0.0/introduction/installing_web_vr.html) section if you're not sure if your computer is ready.

  <strong>Warning:</strong> if your editor ever looks like the image below, you are in Vizor's "Patches" mode and should hit "Tab" on your keyboard to exit. Patches add programming to your world and will be explained in later projects.

## Project Background

Vizor and VR use computer graphics, also known as CG. CG is a field of computer science used to create art, models, animations, films, and more. The project will introduce you to some CG basics, which are used in applications beyond VR.
