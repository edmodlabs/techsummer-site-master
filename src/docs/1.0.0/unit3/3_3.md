## Overview
In this activity, we will explore 360 images as a way to prototype your scenes. In the next activity, we will add your 360 image to Vizor!

## Your First 360 Image
360 images work similar to when you look at a flat world map.  Only when wrapped around a 3D object, does the image look correct, like the earth!

Unbox the 360 Ricoh Theta S camera included in the TechSummer kit.  Remember to keep all the parts, as you will be shipping the camera back to Facebook at the end of the program.  Included in the box should be the camera, a USB cable, a camera case, and a user manual. 

To use the camera, hold down the wireless button and press the power button simultaneously to boot the camera into Selfie Mode.  This is helpful because it gives you a 5-second self timer when taking photos.  

Put the camera on a surface or attach it to a tripod if you have one.  Press the shutter button and pose to take a 360 selfie!  Try this a few times in different places.

  	<strong>Prototype</strong>
  </div> 
  Refer back to your scratch script and plan a <strong>physical prototype</strong> for one scenes. The goal is to test out what the scene will be like, so think about how you can represent the world and the characters. Your 360 image does not have to be exact, just enough to show a rough concept. Be creative and use props or friends to help you out!
