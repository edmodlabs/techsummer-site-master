## Overview
You'll be adding a lot of <strong>patches</strong> for your project, so check out the following for patches pro tips and warnings from our team.

## Adding Objects
What if we try to add objects from the <strong>Objects Tab</strong> instead of the <strong>Patches Tab</strong>?  Selecting the <strong>Objects Tab</strong> forces Vizor into <strong>Build Mode</strong>. That's a big problem because adding objects in <strong>Build Mode</strong> will always add the object to your <strong>Root Scene</strong>.

  	<strong>Adding Objects</strong>
  </div> 
  When using the <strong>Storycasts template</strong> every 3D object needs to be added by placing an <strong>object patch</strong> into the right <strong>nested patch</strong> (Title, Beginning, Middle, or End).
</div>

Hereâ€™s a summary of the correct way to add an object:

1. Use the <strong>Tab</strong> button to make sure you are in <strong>Build Mode</strong>.  
2. Switch to a scene in the viewer using the keyboard hotkeys <strong>J/K/L/P</strong>.
3. Use the <strong>Tab</strong> button again to switch to <strong>Program Mode</strong>.
4. From the <strong>Root</strong> of your <strong>patches</strong>, edit (hit the <strong>pencil icon</strong>) the matching <strong>nested patch</strong> for the scene from Step 2.
5. Drag and drop a 3D object from the <strong>Patches Tab</strong> and connect the 3D object <strong>nested patch</strong> to the <strong>Elements</strong> patch.
6. Switch back into Build Mode to <strong>move</strong>, <strong>rotate</strong> or <strong>scale</strong> the 3D object. 

## Using the Right Patch
Make sure to use the correct <strong>nested patch</strong> for the scene you want to edit.  Switching scenes in the editor (using hotkeys) does not automatically navigate to the right <strong>nested patch</strong> for the scene. 

For example, even while I look at my <strong>Beginning Scene</strong> in the editor, I can navigate inside the nested patch for the Title Scene.

	Switch the Vizor editor scene using the hotkeys, then navigate inside of the correct nested patch for the scene.

  	<strong>Patch Navigation</strong>
  </div> 
  You can navigate <strong>patches</strong> by clicking and dragging.  If your <strong>Program Mode</strong> is cluttered, navigate by scrolling with, clicking, or dragging your middle mouse button. If you have no middle mouse button, you can zoom in and out on your browser.
