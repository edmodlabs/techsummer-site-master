## Overview
Now that you have some 360 images of a prototype scene, let's check them out in Vizor.

## Uploading 360 Images
Follow the steps below to add your 360 images to Vizor.

<ol>
	<li>
		Connect the Ricoh Theta S camera to your computer via the included USB cable.
		<div style="text-align:center">
			<img src="/images/techsummer/Unit3/3.4/connectRicoh.gif">
		</div>
	</li>

	<li>
		Copy the image files to the computer (PC shown, will be similar on a Mac).
		<div style="text-align:center">
			<img src="/images/techsummer/Unit3/3.4/uploadImg.gif">
		</div>
	</li>

	<li>
		Open the Vizor editor and your current Storycast version.  While in <strong>Program Mode</strong>, navigate inside the nested patch for the <strong>Beginning Scene</strong>.
	</li>

	<li>
		Search for the <strong>360 Photo patch</strong> and add the patch.  Connect the <strong>360 Photo nested patch</strong> to the <strong>Elements</strong> patch like you would any other 3D object.

		</div>
	</li>

	<div class="alert_red">
	  Adding the <strong>360 Photo Entity patch</strong> instead of <strong>360 Photo patch</strong> won’t work, as it has no slots or texture that connect from it.
	</div>
	<br>

	<li>
		You’ll notice that unlike the 3D object <strong>nested patch</strong>, the <strong>360 Photo patch</strong> contains two patches instead of one. The connected blue patch is a <strong>Texture</strong> patch, which allows us to change the image that wraps around the sphere object.  
	</li>

	<div class="alert_red">
	  In computer graphics, a <i>texture</i> is an image that wraps around a <i>mesh</i>, which is a 3D object shape.  In this example, the texture is your 360 photo and the mesh is a 3D sphere that surrounds your scene. 
	</div>
	<br>

	<li>
		Edit the texture by selecting the pencil icon on the <strong>Texture patch</strong> connecting to the <strong>360 Photo patch</strong>.  A menu named the <strong>Media Browser</strong> will appear.  The menu stores any media you upload such as images or audio.  The <strong>Browse tab</strong> has default options to use.  Select the <strong>Upload tab</strong> to upload your own 360 photo. If you’re not logged in, you will be asked to log in so the uploaded media is stored in your account.   
	</li>

 	<li>
 		Select <strong>Browse</strong> and find the 360 image file on your computer.  Select <strong>Upload</strong> to upload into the <strong>Media Browser</strong>, which will switch back to the <strong>Browse tab</strong> if the media uploads successfully.  With the uploaded 360 photo highlighted, use <strong>Select</strong> to change the texture image.

		</div>
 	</li>

 	<div class="alert_yellow">
	  Only half of the sphere will appear visible in your scene at first.  To see the full image, disconnect the <strong>Floor</strong> 3D object <strong>nested patch</strong> from the elements patch to hide it.  You can always reconnect it later!  
	</div>
	<br>

	<li>
		Switch back into <strong>Build Mode</strong> and zoom out to see your 3D objects surrounded by your 360 image.  Viola, worlds are colliding!

	<div class="alert_yellow">
	  This effect is sometimes called <i>mixed reality</i> because it combines real footage (the 360 image) with computer graphics (the lab 3D objects).  The downside to 360 images is they aren’t interactive.  Think of them like wallpaper you can use on the outside of your scene.  For example, in Birds of a Feather, we use a 360 image in the <strong>Middle Scene</strong> to give the illusion of being in outer space. Check out [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/pool/) for 360 photos on the web!

  	<strong>Social Activity</strong>
  </div> 
	Before continuing, share your prototype 360 image to the [Facebook group](facebook.com/groups.techsummer).  When posting, Facebook will automatically detect the 360 image, meaning you can interact with the post in neat ways!
