## Pro Tips

So, you're a pro? Not so fast - the VR space changes every day! Even engineers at Facebook are always learning and practicing to be better. Our engineers added the following sections to show pro tips for designing VR projects. Every section has examples you can view on your computer or in virtual reality for a hands-on experience.

### Use Sizes Wisely
The size of objects in virtual reality is very important. If you want to build a realistic experience, you should make sure that objects have believable sizes. However, realistic experiences are not always best. You can change the sizes of objects to make a creative statement, change the meaning of your scene, add goofiness, and more.

In the following scene, a scientist and meditating person landed on a floating island. Soon, they'll use the rocket to blast off to their next destination.

<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_scale_escape" ></script>

In the next scene, we've changed the size of the scientist and rocket objects. Same objects, different sizes, different meaning. What do you think could be a story for the scene?

### Place Objects for Comfortable Viewing

Unlike a game or movie, your user in virtual reality actually needs to look around to see the whole scene. So, the best VR designers are sure to make a scene that is comfortable for users to view. How?

One concept is to make important objects close, and less important objects far away. Check out the following tree in a desert. We're not sure why there's a tree in a desert either, but we do know that since the tree is closer you're more likely to pay attention to the tree than the rocks in the distance.

<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_placement_lone_close_tree" ></script>

Also look at the following project.

<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_placement_cone_spiders" ></script>

Did you notice the giant spiders behind you? Most people don't and, if you didn't, we also don't blame you if you don't want to look. Just remember that your users are most likely to see what you put directly in front of them. It's uncomfortable to look anywhere else.

### Positioning Your User

A final design consideration is where to place your user. When you create a virtual world, you're inviting your user into a world where you build all the rules.

In the following world, your user is an observer of a scientist about to run an experiment on a lab table.

<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_user_placement_observer" ></script>

We can change the position of the VR camera to change the user's experience. In the next world, your user is on the table. Now, your user is the experiment!

<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_user_placement_you_are_experiment" ></script>

### Using the pro tips, how can you make a better virtual world? Have you discovered pro tips of your own? Make some plans, try them in Vizor, and be sure to publish any projects you make!
