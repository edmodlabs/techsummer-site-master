Take your virtual reality design skills to the next level with tips from Facebook engineers! The sections below have examples you can view on your computer or in VR for a hands-on experience.

## Use Sizes Wisely
The size of objects in VR is crucial. Realistic experiences use objects with accurate sizes. However, accurate sizes are not always best. You can alter sizes to make a creative statement, change the meaning of your scene, add goofiness, and more.

Check out how the following scenes have different stories when object sizes vary.

<div style="text-align:center">
	<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_scale_escape" ></script>
	<strong>A scientist and meditating person landed on a deserted, floating island. How long before they take off?</strong> 
</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align:center">
	<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_scale_toys" ></script>
	<strong>Looks like the meditating person is stuck! At least they brought a rocket toy and scientist action figure.</strong> 
</div>

## Place Objects for Comfortable Viewing
Unlike a game or movie, your user in virtual reality actually needs to look around to see a scene. So, great VR designers make worlds that are comfortable to view. How?

One way is to place important objects close, and others far away. Another strategy is to place important objects in front of the user.

<div style="text-align:center">
	<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_placement_lone_close_tree" ></script>
	<strong>The tree is close and therefore your user will imagine it is more important to the story than the rocks in the distance.</strong> 
</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align:center">
	<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_placement_cone_spiders" ></script>
	<strong>Try the world above. Did you notice the giant spiders marching behind you? Probably not. The most important objects should be in front of your user.</strong> 
</div>

## Positioning Your User
Where you place your user determines the rules of your world. In Vizor, you can move the VR camera (the head with a VR headset on) just like any other object.

<div style="text-align:center">
	<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_user_placement_observer" ></script>
	<strong>The VR camera is high in the world, which makes your user an observer of a science experiment.</strong> 
</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align:center">
	<script src="//vizor.io/scripts/embed.js" data-vizorurl="//vizor.io/embed/techstart/vizor_lesson_user_placement_you_are_experiment" ></script>
	<strong>Now the VR camera is on the experiment table. Your user <i>is</i> the science experiment.</strong> 
</div>

<br>

<div class="alert_red">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Do It Yourself!</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	<li>Change the story or meaning of your Vizor projects by altering the object sizes. </li>
  	<li>Reposition objects to make sure users enjoy and understand your world.</li>
  	<li>Move the VR camera to change your user's experience. </li>
  	<li>Run wild with your own techniques and ideas! The VR space is so new you could discover a new design tip! </li>
  </ul>
</div>
