## Vizor Basics

Enough talk - let's jump into Vizor and get started!

### Creating a Vizor Account
You'll first need to create a Vizor account.

* Navigate to <a href="https://vizor.io" target="_blank">vizor.io</a> in your web browser and click on the “Sign Up” button.
* Fill out your information on the “Sign Up” screen and click “Create an Account.” 
* You should see a new screen with links to Vizor tutorials, the Vizor Facebook group, and more. Click the “X” button, wait for the scene to load, and you'll be in the Vizor editor!

### Vizor Editor Guide: Cameras
Many computer graphics programs use multiple cameras. Most often, there will be a “world camera” you use to create and build your application. You can move the world camera wherever you want at any time. In Vizor, the world camera is called “Editor camera” and you can switch into Editor camera mode by clicking the Editor camera button in the editor.

When you open the Vizor editor, you should be using the Editor camera by default.

A world camera is great to use while building, but what will your user's point of view be? Many computer graphics programs also have a second camera to represent your user's view. The camera is named differently in different programs, but in Vizor the camera is called the “VR camera.” The VR camera represents where your user's view will be when they start. 

The position of the VR camera in Vizor is denoted by the model of a head wearing a VR headset in the editor.

You can test the VR camera point of view by selecting the VR camera button in the editor. While in VR camera mode, you can click and drag to test what it would be like for a user to look around your scene.

At any time, you can toggle between the Editor camera and VR camera by pressing "V".
