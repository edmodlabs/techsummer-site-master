Let's learn how to add and manipulate objects in Vizor! Many Vizor techniques work in other CG programs too.

### The Patches Menu
In Vizor, you add 3D objects using the “Patches Menu.” The Patches Menu contains two tabs. 

* The “Objects” tab shows objects you can add to your scene. 
* The “Patches” tab allows you to use programming in Vizor and will be explored in later projects. 

If you do not see the Patches Menus, click the “Patches” button in the Vizor editor. You can click again to make the Patches Menu disappear. You can also click on the Patches Menu and drag to move the menu around.

	<strong>Click the Patches button on the top right to turn the Patches menu on and off.</strong> 
</div>

### Hello Objects!

Now let's add an object to your world!

<div class="alert_red">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong>Do It Yourself!</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	<li>Select the Objects tab in the Patches menu. </li>
  	<li>Select the objects “Objects: Basic” option, then select the “Box” option. </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div style="text-align:center">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQFgFhsqX0c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<br>
	<strong>Click "Box" in the "Objects: Basic" option on the Patches Menu to add a Box.</strong> 
</div>

You should now see a box object in your scene. You can select any object by clicking on the object. You know you've selected an object when red, green, and blue lines appear by the object. Each line is an “axis” and can be used to change the object's position, size, and rotation.

#### Object Manipulation
The following videos show how you can manipulate objects. The "Move," "Scale," and "Rotate" buttons can be found on the rop right of the Vizor editor.

  	<strong>Extra Tips</strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	<li>You can delete an object by selecting the object and pressing “Backspace” or “Delete” on your keyboard. </li>
  	<li>You can undo changes by pressing the “Ctrl” and “Z” button on your keyboard. </li>
  	<li>With an object selected, you can press “Alt” and move the object to create a copy. </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Building a World

Now you're all set to start building your first virtual world! 

<div class="alert_green">
  <div style="text-align:center">
  	<strong><u>Before You Continue</u></strong> 
  </div>
  <ul> 
  	<li>Add at least 5 objects to your scene and modify the objects as much as you want. Try the many different options in the Objects menu! </li>
