### Hello Virtual Reality!

You've learned about the basics of cameras in computer graphics and Vizor navigation. There's tons more that you could learn about computer graphics and Vizor, but for now let's focus on designing a virtual world. Let's get building!

#### Fun With Objects

In Vizor, you add 3D objects using the “Patches Menu.” The Patches Menu contains two tabs. 

* The “Objects” tab shows objects you can add to your scene. 
* The “Patches” tab allows you to use programming to make your scene dynamic and will be explored in later projects. 

If you do not see the Patches Menus, click the “Patches” button in the Vizor editor. You can click again to make the Patches Menu disappear. You can also click on the Patches Menu and drag to move the menu around.

Now let's add an object!

* Select the Objects tab in the Patches Menu.
* Select the objects “Objects: Basic” option, then select the “Box” option.

You should now see a 3-dimensional box in your scene. You can use the Vizor editor to change the position, size, or rotation of any object. 

* Select your object. You've selected an object when red, green, and blue lines appear by the object. Each line represents an “axis” you can use to adjust the object. The plural form of axis is “axes,” which is pronounced “axe-zeez”.
* Select the “Move” button, then click and drag on any of the object axes to change the object position.

* Select the “Scale” button, then click and drag on any of the object axes to make the object bigger or smaller.

* Select the “Rotate” button, then click and drag on any of the object axes to change the object rotation.

### Advanced Controls

You can delete an object at any time by selecting the object and pressing “Backspace” or “Delete” on your keyboard. 

You can undo your changes by pressing the “Ctrl” and “Z” button on your keyboard. 

With an object selected, you can press “Alt” and move the object to create a copy.

### Building a World

You're all set to start building your first virtual world. Add objects to your scene and modify the scene as much as you'd like. We recommend only using objects that appear under the “Objects:” items in the Patches Menu. Make a scene you would like to show a friend and add at least 5 objects to the scene before you continue.
