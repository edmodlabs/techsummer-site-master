## Overview
Let's take a break from pure technical details and consider the high level experience of your story.

## Why VR?
Let’s take a big step back and ask ourselves why VR is the right medium for our story.  A <i>medium</i> is a collection of materials that when combined create some narrative.  A painting is a medium composed of texture and color.  A film is a medium composed of images and time.  As virtual reality storytelling matures, many critics question how it differs from film and video games as its own medium. 

VR is different because it creates a quick sense of immersive <i>presence</i> with the viewer, which happens faster and often stronger than other mediums.  Presence means forgetting about the physical world (which could also happen with a captivating novel or film).  Good VR storytelling requires a more balanced pace of story progression.  In an action film, we accept that images move very quickly.  But in VR, we have to adjust the pace at which story is delivered to give users enough time to accommodate scene changes or the interaction demands on the user. 

The Storycast <strong>template</strong> has been crafted to address this, but you can tweak the story pace in Vizor using <strong>Timer patches</strong>.  A <strong>Timer</strong> is a <strong>patch</strong> type that controls the speed of time using a computer clock that ticks, much like the hands around an old school clock.  The default Vizor Storycast <strong>template</strong> provided has <i>interactive</i> pacing, meaning the user proceeds through the story by selecting the <strong>Next button</strong> objects.  You can also create <i>linear</i> pacing, where the scenes move forward automatically using a <strong>Timer patch</strong>.  Next, you will learn how to change your Storycast from an interactive to a linear narrative.    

## Pacing
If you want, you can change the pacing style of your story.

First, make sure you’re in the <strong>Root</strong> of the <strong>Program Mode</strong>, and look for a blue patch called <strong>Timer</strong>. This will change the scenes automatically without the user having to select the <strong>Next buttons</strong>.  To enable or disable this function, click on the <strong>On/Off button</strong> in the <strong>patch</strong>.  Under the <strong>Timer patch</strong> there are three more blue patches for the <strong>Beginning Scene</strong>, <strong>Middle Scene</strong> and <strong>End Scene</strong>.  The patches contain values, and in this case each value is a clock duration in seconds.  The values in each blue patch control how long each scene will show before switching to the next one.  Think of it like an automatic timer for a slideshow, where each Vizor scene is a slide.  

<div style="text-align:center">

  	</div> 
	If you use the <strong>Timer</strong> option, each duration should be longer than the audio narration for the scene or the audio will cut off abruptly when the scene changes. You can also hide the <strong>Next button</strong> objects. Since they are 3D objects, you can hide them by disconnecting the patch from the <strong>Elements</strong> patch.  Don’t worry, you can always reconnect it later to make it reappear!

Does the story feel different if it moves along automatically?  As the director of your Storycast, you should make the call on whether it works better as an interactive or a linear narrative.  There’s no correct choice, test both in your VR Viewer and make a creative call.
