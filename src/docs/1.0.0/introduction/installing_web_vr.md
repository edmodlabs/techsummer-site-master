  </div>
  WebVR enables a browser to communicate with your headset. To summarize, the browser creates and controls your virtual scene then sends the information to your headset so you can see VR. Many browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox Nightly, Internet Explorer, etc.) were not built for VR, so new browsers must be used.
