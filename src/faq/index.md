## Where can I ask questions or get help?
Here are the steps to getting you what you need:
1. Post in the [TechSummer Facebook group](facebook.com/groups/techsummer). 
	
	We prefer to answer questions on the Facebook Group so everyone can see the solutions. Chances are if you are running into something, others are as well.

2. Did posting in the group not work out? Come to office hours! 


## Should I use this website or the Facebook Group for materials?
The [TechSummer Facebook group](facebook.com/groups/techsummer) is the best place to stay tuned about TechSummer. If you cannot join the group, we will send you important info via email and you can still complete the entire program via the [TechSummer Github](techsummer.github.io).

## Who Should and Shouldn't use the VR Headset?
Health and Saftey  forbids anyone from under 13 from using the headset.

## Do I get to keep the VR Viewers after the program is done?
Absolutely. These VR Viewers are yours to keep forever and customize as you see fit.

## What if I cannot join the TechSummer Facebook group?


## What will I learn from TechSummer?
You'll learn how to build a VR viewer and tell a VR story using an online platform named Vizor. Expect to exercise your creative and technology skills. You can also come to office hours to ask technology questions to our team at Facebook!

## What if I have never written code before? 
Don't sweat it! TechSummer only assumes you have an interest in learning technology skills. Vizor uses a visual programming tool so you can get a first taste of programming and go even deeper if you want to create more complex experiences.
