## What age range is appropriate for the VR Kit?
The VR headset is not for use by children under age 13 according to the official health and safety warning. 

## What hardware does TechStart provide to qualifying schools?
The VR Kit includes the following items:
* One Oculus-Ready computer that meets the Oculus minimum specs and is approved by Oculus IT.
* Mouse and Keyboard
* One Oculus Rift
* One 24” Monitor
* One Ricoh Theta S 360 Camera
* One Camera Stand
* One Starter Kit documenting how to use TechStart equipment in a school.

## How will the equipment be used? 
We provide instructions to get started experiencing and creating virtual reality. It is up to the teachers themselves to decide and innovate on how they would like to integrate the VR kit into their classrooms.
 
## How could we evaluate its use?
It is important to us that teachers themselves to evaluate how successful the VR Kit is for their classrooms
as well as students. We will be sending over surveys assessing the experience at various times and welcome as much ongoing feedback as possible.
 
## Are there any ongoing expenses or upkeep?
There are no costs to maintaining the VR Kit. However, TechStart isn’t responsible for damages or repairs to the kit. The PC has a 1 year warranty and the virtual reality headset can be serviced via the customer service department at oculus. The equipment we are donating is expensive and sensitive to damage, so it is important to take the necessary precautions to keep the equipment undamaged as you see appropriate.
